        <p>Yo, I'm Ti, a CS student, future software dev, wannabe startup founder, and a lowkey ML wizard. A Ravenclaw at heart, but let's be real—probably a Gryffindor because of, well... Harry. This page was inspired by <a href="https://melqtx.tech/">Melano's</a> awesome site—tweaked to add my own magical touch.</p>
        <p>Currently brewing up some code like a digital potions master:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning (teaching robots to think so I don't have to—Wingardium Intelli-osa)</li>
            <li>Web Development (crafting digital Marauder's Maps)</li>
            <li>Python (Parseltongue for coding wizards)</li>
            <li>C/C++ (for when Python is moving slower than a troll in the dungeon)</li>
            <li>DS & Algos (sorting algorithms are basically Sorting Hat magic)</li>
            <li>OOP (summoning objects like a true Transfiguration expert)</li>
            <li>OS (juggling processes like a multitasking wizard—Accio multitasking!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When not coding: reading books (sometimes spellbooks), pretending to be Ansel Adams, watching mind-bending films, and listening to music that isn't just CPU fan noise—though it sometimes sounds like a Howler.</p>
        
        <p>Remember, as Feynman said, "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." Same goes for my code, but hey, even Dumbledore said, "We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided." So let's learn together.</p>
