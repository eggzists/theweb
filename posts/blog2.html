    <p>salut</p>
    <p>i started learning physics, around when i was 14 years of age it was like a land of fairytales for me. 
    <br>i thought that particles travel in a defined straight path and they were expected to follow the same path
    but thats when quantam slapped me in the face, with even weirder things like the double slit experiment. i was flabbergasted by the fact that particles can behave like waves and waves can behave like particles. it was a whole new world of possibilities.
    <br>and then i thought, what if we are all just particles in a universe that is a simulation? what if we are all just bits of information in a computer program? what if our reality is just a hologram projected by some advanced civilization?
    <br>learning that particles exists as both wave and particle was no less than a door to new possibilities, it opened door to more thoughts, more experiments and at the same time more confusion going around because there wan't any concrete experiments and theory to describe it further.
    <br>so as to satisfy my own curiosities and the surfers like you reading this, i'll be covering Quantam Mechanics in a series of posts, i will be discussing about the quantam world, the developments around it and how it is not what we think it is.

      so whenever we look at the light and the path travelled by it, lets say from point A to point B, we would see that it is the most optimised path, but did it really optimise the path? or did it just take the path that it had to take because it was obeying local rules?
      but heres what happens it explores all paths, and the fact that we only see it as a single path is the biggest illusion nature has ever come up with
